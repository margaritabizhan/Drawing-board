## More Features Are In Progress
- **Collaboration Tools**: web sockets integration to enable real-time collaboration. This will allow multiple users to draw on the same canvas simultaneously, opening up new possibilities for cooperative drawing sessions and interactive projects.
- **Save Drawings**: Implementing the ability to save and share drawings is also on our roadmap.
